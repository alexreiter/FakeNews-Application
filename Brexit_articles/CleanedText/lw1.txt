debunks
the
myths
that
brexit
policy
being
driven
cabal
hedge
funds
dodgy
corporations
and
tax
avoiders
these
myths
turn
out
more
than
vague
insinuations
and
desperate
mudslinging
the
hope
that
some
might
stick
the
proliferation
daft
conspiracy
theories
has
been
one
the
more
depressing
features
the
painful
process
leaving
the
you
might
expect
this
nonsense
from
notoriously
sloppy
journalists
fake
news
websites
desperate
politicians
but
even
some
otherwise
fairly
sensible
people
have
claimed
that
government
policy
being
driven
cabal
hedge
funds
dodgy
corporations
and
tax
avoiders
who
stand
benefit
from
hard
brexit
one
the
worst
recent
examples
can
blamed
byline
media
which
revealed
that
some
donors
boris
johnsons
leadership
campaign
andor
vote
leave
have
links
hedge
funds
with
short
positions
equities
fortunately
this
story
has
now
been
thoroughly
debunked
every
serious
financial
commentator
who
has
looked
including
frances
coppola
chris
dillow
juliet
samuel
and
the
team
the
brief
byline
seems
have
got
its
figures
wrong
explained
here
full
fact
more
importantly
pure
financial
illiteracy
assume
that
short
positions
equities
are
anything
with
brexit
they
are
far
more
likely
bet
against
particular
companies
with
weak
fundamentals
and
perhaps
even
hedge
against
bigger
long
position
they
could
simply
reflection
bearish
view
the
valuation
equities
generally
both
the
and
elsewhere
other
news
outlets
have
made
the
same
mistake
the
sunday
times
has
suggested
that
short
positions
held
fund
run
crispin
odey
companies
such
the
royal
mail
and
intu
shopping
centre
owner
are
somehow
play
deal
these
are
certainly
not
companies
that
choose
sell
were
worried
about
brexit
similar
nonsense
has
appeared
private
eye
and
dutifully
parroted
other
remain
supporting
publications
such
the
whats
more
hedge
funds
are
rarely
controlled
one
person
indeed
the
principals
some
the
funds
cited
included
prominent
supporters
both
leave
and
remain
other
conspiracy
theorists
have
focused
the
fact
that
many
speculators
have
been
running
short
positions
sterling
not
actually
aware
any
real
evidence
even
the
byline
standard
that
brexit
backers
are
more
likely
betting
against
the
pound
but
anyone
with
view
the
market
impact
deal
will
position
their
portfolios
accordingly
thats
their
job
and
its
bit
odd
for
former
chancellor
top
treasury
official
criticise
them
for
doing
and
yet
still
the
conspiracy
theories
pile
another
dodgy
claim
that
brexit
being
driven
the
desire
escape
tax
avoidance
measures
due
come
into
force
this
trope
was
recently
reheated
the
economist
simon
wren
lewis
blog
which
also
claimed
that
brexiters
have
controlled
the
narrative
around
brexit
only
and
that
the
number
people
passionate
about
brexit
limited
few
thousand
people
happens
suspect
that
the
number
leave
supporters
who
are
even
aware
the
tax
avoidance
measures
vanishingly
small
but
this
would
feeble
reason
back
brexit
anyway
take
this
position
youd
have
confident
that
the
government
would
not
keep
these
measures
after
brexit
despite
having
shown
every
intention
planning
fact
these
measures
are
designed
support
oecd
wide
initiatives
that
the
itself
has
helped
lead
the
eus
own
track
record
here
actually
pretty
poor
youd
like
know
more
recommend
this
blog
genuine
tax
expert
brexit
really
about
tax
avoidance
which
explains
the
finer
points
far
better
than
ever
could
short
though
the
essentials
the
measures
are
already
part
tax
law
and
will
remain
come
what
may
needless
say
jeremy
corbyn
has
also
tapped
into
the
disaster
capitalism
narrative
with
pledge
everything
can
stop
bankers
brexit
this
phrase
presumably
designed
appeal
the
hard
left
and
the
fbpe
echo
chamber
nonetheless
lazy
slogans
still
takes
some
beating
lets
not
forget
that
goldman
sachs
morgan
citigroup
and
morgan
stanley
all
donated
substantial
six
figure
sums
the
remain
campaign
ahead
the
referendum
other
major
remain
supporters
included
the
financier
mark
coombs
and
the
hedge
fund
owner
david
harding
both
counted
among
the
dreaded
billionaires
and
thats
even
without
mentioning
george
soros
what
was
corbyn
driving
course
hes
partly
recycling
the
familiar
claptrap
that
are
controlled
shadowy
bankers
and
their
dark
money
apparently
leave
supporters
are
particularly
susceptible
these
evil
influences
but
this
narrative
doesnt
make
any
more
sense
you
look
the
substance
what
then
said
the
labour
leader
goes
there
were
reports
over
the
long
weekend
that
the
tories
are
going
out
with
their
begging
bowl
billionaire
hedge
funders
raise
cash
for
autumn
general
election
let
one
any
doubt
what
these
super
rich
donors
will
paying
for
the
chaos
and
uncertainty
caused
deal
brexit
potential
goldmine
for
speculators
betting
against
the
pound
this
daft
many
levels
but
lets
just
turn
the
logic
around
does
this
mean
that
the
financiers
who
backed
remain
who
now
oppose
deal
brexit
are
only
doing
because
they
hope
gain
personally
from
rebound
sterling
course
not
corbyn
warmed
further
his
theme
but
the
payout
for
those
elements
the
super
rich
that
support
deal
wont
just
stop
there
leave
without
deal
october
they
will
use
the
crisis
push
through
policies
that
benefit
them
and
hurt
everyone
else
they
have
since
this
guff
corbyn
does
not
and
cannot
explain
how
the
super
rich
will
able
push
anything
through
parliament
particularly
this
one
can
debate
the
pros
and
cons
bolder
measures
liberalise
the
economy
lighten
the
burdens
tax
and
regulations
and
increase
consumer
choice
including
the
nhs
but
there
simply
majority
for
the
more
sweeping
changes
that
corbyn
would
have
fear
nor
there
likely
one
any
time
soon
its
yet
another
disaster
capitalism
myth
claim
that
brexit
will
give
any
government
free
hand
whatever
likes
were
just
left
with
vague
accusations
and
mudslinging
the
hope
that
some
might
stick
byline
has
doubled
down
suggesting
that
boris
johnsons
decision
making
could
swayed
his
reliance
financial
institutions
and
hedge
funds
for
donations
but
this
doesnt
work
any
level
either
even
these
donations
did
help
johnson
become
hes
now
accountable
the
entire
british
electorate
hopefully
will
soon
whats
more
you
could
make
the
same
insinuations
bad
faith
against
almost
anybody
for
example
labour
heavily
dependent
money
from
trade
unions
the
cbi
gets
most
its
money
from
big
business
some
recent
brexit
work
the
national
institute
economic
and
social
research
niesr
has
been
funded
the
peoples
vote
campaign
could
reality
most
people
even
politicians
take
particular
view
position
because
they
genuinely
believe
thats
true
all
sides
the
brexit
debate
too
others
might
then
support
them
including
financially
because
they
agree
with
that
position
but
its
crucial
get
the
direction
causation
the
right
way
around
would
you
argue
for
example
that
molly
scott
cato
only
backs
green
causes
because
earns
her
meps
salary
again
course
not
paradoxically
still
get
trolled
half
wits
for
pro
bono
work
with
the
institute
economic
affairs
even
though
they
should
know
now
that
this
work
unpaid
doubtless
ill
get
stick
for
this
blog
too
summary
the
disaster
capitalism
narrative
based
least
three
ridiculous
assumptions
first
that
only
the
can
ever
trusted
the
right
thing
and
wed
therefore
lost
without
them
second
that
the
johnson
administration
beholden
cabal
special
interests
motivated
solely
money
and
third
that
brexit
would
give
any
government
free
hand
whatever
likes
serious
commentators
should
able
lot
better
than
peddling
such
nonsense
