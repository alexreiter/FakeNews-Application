the

moves

this

french

seems
that

which
most
this

ignored

apparently

assume
that
hmg
could
manage
even
this
worst
case
conducting
its
own

outside

apparently
the
worst
case
that

simply
sit

unmanaged

all
these
apocalyptic
scenarios
have
course
been
enthusiastically
broadcast

what
they
really
amount
apparently
our

firms
transporting
the
continent
find
themselves
unable

with
french
customs

for

yes
indeed
however
the

does
quietly
admit
that

not
point
out
that

there
any

which
precisely
what
the
calais

authorities
fear
nor
there
any
mention

already
taken
foreign
producers
who
will
wish
protect
their

the
danish
producer

serious
lurid

are
both
unlikely

this
poor

report
written
way
that
would
obviously
cause
maximum
unease

was
course
leaked

ignore
some
will
respond
that
the
damage

opinion
has
already
been
done
this
may

large
proportion
the
electorate
know
exaggeration
when
then
see
and
are
just
likely
discount

scare

were
