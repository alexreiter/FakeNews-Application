the

quickly
realised
that
they

have
line

for
the

moment
their

they
could
not
answer
back
but
were
the

doomed

was
satisfy
romantic
myth
and
the
purpose

key
early
victim
was
the

finally
and

shamefully
came
the

ambassador
the
kim
darroch
who
resigned
after
someone
leaked
his
frank
diplomatic
cables
darroch
became
pawn
much
larger
campaign
which
ultimately
demands
the
replacement
politically
neutral

with
sycophantic

courtiers
those
who
fail

must
simply
purged
the

most
enduring

has
been
the

this
lies
the
greatest
irony
the
process
advertised
take

for

fronted
relentless

the

the

not

you
shut

you
shut
down

this
week
mps
voted
against
prorogation
but
many
further

the
pursuit

what
can
see
now
britain
kind
national
derangement
has
become
clear
that
brexit
was
never
about
leaving

creed
from
people
trapped
into

submission
this
dogma
purges
dissent
erases

expels
non

because
the

must
not
spoken
the

must
silenced
time

brexits
leaders
are
seeking
