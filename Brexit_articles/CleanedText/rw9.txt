the
new
project
fear
since
theresa
mays
lancaster
house
speech
january
this
year
two
new
project
fears
have
sprung
the
first
from
the
labour
party
eftauk
liberal
leave
leave
and
richard
north
states
that
need
remain
members
the
eus
internal
market
after
officially
leave
the
even
though
there
are
over
countries
outside
the
single
market
which
have
free
access
via
free
trade
agreements
the
second
from
nick
boles
lord
hague
and
chancellor
philip
hammond
states
that
need
have
transitional
period
four
years
during
which
time
wed
still
members
the
single
market
and
the
customs
union
before
pay
these
campaigns
and
their
claims
any
attention
should
bear
mind
just
how
wrong
the
previous
project
fears
which
were
often
run
the
very
same
people
really
were
the
first
project
fear
said
need
join
the
european
economic
community
eec
called
common
market
and
well
export
more
the
the
exact
opposite
has
happened
weve
exported
less
and
less
the
and
had
record
high
trade
deficit
with
the
billion
the
second
said
need
join
the
european
exchange
rate
mechanism
erm
but
this
was
then
disaster
for
and
led
black
wednesday
the
third
said
need
join
the
euro
and
dont
londons
business
will
grind
halt
the
exact
opposite
has
happened
the
fourth
said
need
stay
the
and
dont
therell
recession
the
immediate
aftermath
leave
vote
weve
instead
had
record
levels
prosperity
since
the
brexit
vote
all
project
fears
economic
predictions
were
wrong
except
will
admit
for
their
prediction
about
sterling
they
correctly
predicted
that
there
would
significant
fall
the
value
the
pound
sterling
the
immediate
aftermath
leave
vote
and
the
pound
has
fallen
value
about
average
however
remoaners
seem
want
think
that
the
value
the
pound
the
only
least
the
main
indicator
the
strength
the
economy
this
any
economist
will
tell
you
nonsense
there
are
other
indicators
such
the
ftse
the
ftse
our
output
our
exports
our
unemployment
rate
the
amount
foreign
direct
investment
attract
and
the
rate
our
economic
growth
which
are
equally
important
not
more
important
than
the
relative
value
sterling
all
these
factors
must
together
taken
into
account
before
judgement
can
made
the
strength
the
economy
the
ftse
has
hit
four
new
record
highs
since
the

and
months

the
plans

the
ftse
which
widely
acknowledged
being
the
best
gauge
domestic
economic
sentiment
also
reached
record
high

remoaners
constantly
told
the
months
after
brexit
that
the
reason
why
there
still
hadnt
been
recession
due
brexit
was
because
the
government
hadnt
revealed

isolation
the
remoaners
are
far
from
telling
the
whole
story
firstly
they
all
just
presume
that
they
can
know
for
certain
that
the
devaluation
was
indeed
caused
the
brexit
vote
alone
correlation
does
not
however
prove
causation
could
just
coincidence
other
factors
could
involved
jacob
rees
mogg
has
pointed
that
both
the
oecd
and
the
imf
had
said
before
the
referendum
that
the
value
the
pound
was
too
high
even
strong
remainer
ken
clarke
has
admitted
this
even
lord
mervyn
king
the
former
governor
the
bank
england
has
said
that
the
devaluation
welcome
fact
therefore
devaluation
was
only
matter
time
and
the
brexit
vote
merely
brought
forward
this
already
inevitable
devaluation
the
columnist
peter
hitchens
foresaw
devaluation
way
before
the
referendum
and
states
that
the
devaluation
has
nothing
with
the
brexit
vote
and
would
have
also
happened
had
voted
remain
however
remoaners
presume
that
this
devaluation
has
only
been
negative
for
the
economy
this
false
has
not
led
out
control
inflation
many
predicted
inflation
actually
fell

last
year
months
after
the
brexit
vote
jacob
rees
mogg
has
pointed
out
that
the
last
two
significant
devaluations
before
the
brexit
vote
and
the
early
both
resulted
lasting
periods
prosperity
and
rising
living
standards
news
the
devaluation
has
been
happily
received
exporters
who
have
long
said
that
the
value
the
pound
has
been
too
high
for
too
long
the
devaluation
has
made
their
exports
cheaper
and
more
competitive
relatively
speaking
and
his
consequently
increased
demand
for
our
exports
overseas
fact
september
last
year
exports
reached
their
highest
level
years
finally
remoaners
are
always
negative
and
pessimistic
about
our
chances
getting
good
free
trade
agreement
with
the
agreed
midnight
march
however
even
the
most
unlikely
and
worst
case
scenario
there
being
brexit
deal
all
then
the
average
devaluation
would
easily
dwarf
