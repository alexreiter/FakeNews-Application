before
the

rehearses
the

are
serious

dealt
with
cool
assessment
the
impact
deal
suggests
that
manageable
outcome
many
like
claim
that
deal
off
the
table
but
remains
the
legal
default
position
and
the
may
not
bluffing
claiming
that
now
the
most
likely
endgame
has
course
been
decisively
rejected
parliament
but
has
almost
everything
else
decisive
parliamentary
rejection
has
also

been

consideration

the

with
the
adjectives

they
have
been
greatly

the

greatly
damage
the

started
early
with
detailed

treasury
and
other
economics
groups
during
the

campaign
their
absurdly
wrong
short

damaged
the

all
this
